# 🧩 Project MB - Puzzle

> *Explore the maze. Uncover the mystery. Conquer with logic.*

---

## 📌 Key Concepts

- 🔍 **Procedurally generated mazes** using powerful **maze generation algorithms** (Binary Tree, DFS, Sidewinder, Aldous-Broder, etc.)
- 🚶 **Player-driven exploration** – no predefined path, no hand-holding.
- 🗝️ **Hidden items** containing **riddle-based clues** that reveal parts of the story.
- 🧠 **A mysterious storyline** woven into the puzzles and maze structure.
- 💡 A **fusion of strategy, logic, and curiosity** – where players don’t just play the game, they *decode* it.

## 🌌 Player Experience

> Every run generates a new map.  
> Every path reveals new secrets.  
> Every solution unlocks the next layer of the narrative.

You are the **explorer**, **decoder**, and **storyteller** of your own journey.

## 🎮 Gameplay Highlights

| Algorithm         | Maze Characteristics              | Player Experience                               |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Binary Tree       | Simple, few dead ends             | Great for beginner levels                        |
| DFS               | Branchy with many dead ends       | Tests memory and spatial reasoning               |
| Sidewinder        | Unpredictable paths               | Perfect for mid-difficulty levels                |
| Aldous-Broder     | Fully random structure            | Diverse, hard-to-anticipate labyrinths           |

## 🧠 Why Algorithms?

Each algorithm isn’t just a map generator —  
it’s a **logic puzzle in disguise**.  
To solve the maze is to **understand its core principle**.
